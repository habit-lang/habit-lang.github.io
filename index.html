<h1>Habit: a new functional programming language</h1>

<p>
  Habit is a pure functional language that explores the intersection of low-level programming
  problems and high-level programming paradigms.
</p>

<p>
  We believe that the potential for such languages can be seen in recent verified software
  development projects, such as the construction of the seL4 microkernel.  These projects are
  landmark achievements for formal verification, but the effort required makes such
  techniques inaccessible for the majority of software projects.  For example, the functional
  correctness proofs for the seL4 kernel are an order of magnitude longer than the combined
  specification and implementation of the kernel, and construction of the proof required an
  estimated 20 person years.  Because the seL4 kernel is written in C, some portion of this
  proof effort was needed to ensure that the implementation avoids common sources of bugs and
  security vulnerabilities in C programs such as buffer overflows and null pointer
  dereferences. Might it be possible instead to write software like this in a higher level
  programming language where such guarantees are obtained <em>automatically</em> as a result,
  for example, of type checking?  How much impact might this have on the overall cost of
  verification?  And can we still obtain the levels of raw performance and predictability
  that are typically required in systems programming when we are using higher level languages
  like this?
</p>


<h2>Features of Habit</h2>

<p>
  Habit's syntax and type system are inspired by Haskell, while its semantics are inspired by ML.
  Its distinctive character arises from three particular focuses.  First, Habit provides safe
  manipulation of low-level data, by extending notions of algebraic datatypes to bit-level
  specification of value and memory layouts.  Second, Habit includes powerful new mechanisms for
  type-level programming, providing more flexible, expressive forms of type-directed generic
  programming.  Third, Habit has experimental support for a novel form of substructural typing,
  providing a foundation for capturing state, protocols, and other facets of program behavior in
  types without losing the expressiveness of functional programming.
</p>

<h3>Safe manipulation of low-level data</h3>

<p>
  Algebraic data types provide a high-level view of data, guaranteeing safe and efficient
  construction and deconstruction of data while abstracting from details of representation.  Bitdata
  provides the same guarantees of safe construction and deconstruction for word-sized (or smaller)
  values, while allowing exact specification of data layout, avoiding the need (and potential for
  error) in manual bit masking and manipulation.  Habit also provides bytedata, which provides a
  similar level of control of representation for larger, memory-based data structures.  The
  following papers describe bitdata and bytedata, giving motivation, examples, and the
  details of their typing and compilation.

  "High-level Views on Low-level Representations".
</p>
<div class="abstract" id="bitdata">
  <p>
    This paper explains how the high-level treatment of datatypes in functional languages---using
    features like constructor functions and pattern matching---can be made to coexist with
    bitdata. We use this term to describe the bit-level representations of data that are required in
    the construction of many different applications, including operating systems, device drivers,
    and assemblers. We explain our approach as a combination of two language extensions, each of
    which could potentially be adapted to any modern functional language. The first adds simple and
    elegant constructs for manipulating raw bitfield values, while the second provides a view-like
    mechanism for defining distinct new bitdata types with fine-control over the underlying
    representation. Our design leverages polymorphic type inference, as well as techniques for
    improvement of qualified types, to track both the type and the width of bitdata structures. We
    have implemented our extensions in a small functional language interpreter, and used it to show
    that our approach can handle a wide range of practical bitdata types.

  "Strongly Typed Memory Areas: Programming Systems-Level Data Structures in a Functional Language".
</p>
<div class="abstract" id="bytedata">
  <p>
    Modern functional languages offer several attractive features to support development of reliable
    and secure software. However, in our efforts to use Haskell for systems programming
    tasks---including device driver and operating system construction---we have also encountered
    some significant gaps in functionality. As a result, we have been forced, either to code some
    non-trivial components in more traditional but unsafe languages like C or assembler, or else to
    adopt aspects of the foreign function interface that compromise on strong typing and type
    safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this paper, we describe how we have filled one of these gaps by extending a Haskell-like
    language with facilities for working directly with low-level, memory-based data
    structures. Using this extension, we are able to program a wide range of examples, including
    hardware interfaces, kernel data structures, and operating system APIs. Our design allows us to
    address concerns about representation, alignment, and placement (in virtual or physical address
    spaces) that are critical in some systems applications, but clearly beyond the scope of most
    existing functional languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our approach leverages type system features that are well-known and widely supported in existing
    Haskell implementations, including kinds, multiple parameter type classes, functional
    dependencies, and improvement. One interesting feature is the use of a syntactic abbreviation
    that makes it easy to define and work with functions at the type level.

<h3>Expressive automatic type-level programming</h3>

<p>
  Type classes provide a powerful facility for characterizing types, and so can provide strong
  typing for overloading (ad hoc polymorphism).  Habit builds on existing type class systems in
  several ways.  First, we provide enhanced syntactic support for functional dependencies, which
  allow us to characterize type-level computation.  Second, we introduce a notion of negation for
  predicates, which both refine class specifications and can capture additional safety properties.
  Finally, we introduce alternatives in instance declarations; in combination with negated
  predicates (or functional dependencies) these provide a significant increase in expressiveness
  compared to other type class systems or other mechanisms for automatic type-level programming.
  The following paper give overview of programming with functional dependencies and of instance
  chains, which combine negated predicates and alternatives in instances.

  "Language and Program Design for Functional Dependencies".
</p>

<div class="abstract" id="fundeps-design">
  <p>
    Eight years ago, functional dependencies, a concept from the theory of relational databases,
    were proposed as a mechanism for avoiding common problems with multiple parameter type classes
    in Haskell. In this context, functional dependencies give programmers a means to specify the
    semantics of a type class more precisely, and to obtain more accurate inferred types as a
    result. As time passed, however, several issues were uncovered---both in the design of a
    language to support functional dependencies, and in the ways that programmers use them---that
    led some to search for new, better alternatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    This paper focuses on two related aspects of design for functional dependencies: (i) the design
    of language/type system extensions that implement them; and (ii) the design of programs that use
    them. Our goal is to clarify the issues of what functional dependencies are, how they should be
    used, and how the problems encountered with initial proposals and implementations can be
    addressed.

  "Instance Chains: Type Class Programming Without Overlapping Instances".
</p>

<div class="abstract" id="instances">
  <p>
    Type classes have found a wide variety of uses in Haskell programs, from simple overloading of
    operators (such as equality or ordering) to complex invariants used to implement type-safe
    heterogeneous lists or limited subtyping.  Unfortunately, many of the richer uses of type
    classes require extensions to the class system that have been incompletely described in the
    research literature and are not universally accepted within the Haskell community.
  </p>

  <p>
    This paper describes a new type class system, implemented in a prototype tool
    called <tt>ilab</tt>, that simplifies and enhances Haskell-style type-class programming.
    In <tt>ilab</tt>, we replace overlapping instances with a new feature, <i>instance chains</i>,
    allowing explicit alternation and failure in instance declarations.  We describe a technique for
    ascribing semantics to type class systems, relating classes, instances, and class constraints
    (such as kind signatures or functional dependencies) directly to a set-theoretic model of
    relations on types.  Finally, we give a semantics for <tt>ilab</tt> and describe its
    implementation.

<h3>Sound foundations for linear and behavioral typing</h3>

<p>
  A more experimental feature of Habit is its support for linear (and substructural) typing.  Linear
  type systems provide a general mechanism to stateful safety properties with types.  For example,
  we can use linear type to assure that file handles are not used after they are closed, track
  capabilities, or check communication protocols (expressed as session types).  While there has been
  significant research on linear types and their usage, Habit provides a unique mechanism to
  integrate linear and functional programming.  The following paper gives an overview of our linear
  type system, and additional examples of the integration of linear and functional programming.

</p>

<div class="abstract" id="bobw">
  <p>
    We present a linear functional calculus with both the safety guarantees expressible with linear
    types and the rich language of combinators and composition provided by functional programming.
    Unlike previous combinations of linear typing and functional programming, we compromise neither
    the linear side (for example, our linear values are first-class citizens of the language) nor
    the functional side (for example, we do not require duplicate definitions of compositions for
    linear and unrestricted functions).  To do so, we must generalize abstraction and application to
    encompass both linear and unrestricted functions.  We capture the typing of the generalized
    constructs with a novel use of qualified types.  Our system maintains the metatheoretic
    properties of the theory of qualified types, including principal types and decidable type
    inference.  Finally, we give a formal basis for our claims of expressiveness, by showing that
    evaluation respects linearity, and that our language is a conservative extension of existing
    functional calculi.

<h2>Getting involved</h2>

<p>
  The Habit language and its prototype implementation are open-source projects developed by a small
  international team of researchers.  We welcome feedback and contributions.
</p>

<p>
  Complementing the formal descriptions above,
  the <a href="http://github.com/habit-lang/language-report">Habit language report</a> gives a
  holistic specification of the language syntax and standard environment, including the
  predefined types and type classes.  It also includes an extended example of Habit programming,
  showing how Habit's functional and low-level features come together in describing an efficient
  implementation of a priority queue.  Note that there have been a few relatively small changes
  to the language design since this document was last updated in 2010, but most parts of the
  language are still as described in the report.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the formal description of the language and its features, we are also developing
  tooling for the language.  We have a type-checker and interpreter,
  called <a href="http://github.com/habit-lang/alb">Alb</a>, and a compiler targeting LLVM is
  currently in development.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
  The Habit language was originally developed as part of
  the <a href="http://hasp.cs.pdx.edu">HASP</a> (High-Assurance Systems Programming) project at
  <a href="http://pdx.edu/computer-science/">Portland State University</a>, and built on the
  experience of <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/icfp05.pdf">House</a>, an operating system
  written in Haskell.
